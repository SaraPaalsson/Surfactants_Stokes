Welcome to Surfactant-Stokes's documentation!
=============================================

This is the documentation for a yet-to-be-named highly accurate boundary integral solver for droplets in two dimensional Stokes flow. Surface tension is modified with added surfactants on the drop interfaces. A special quadrature to evaluate integrals close to the droplet boundaries is used to reduce errors.  

This code has been and is developed by Sara PÃ¥lsson, Rikard Ojala and Anna-Karin Tornberg.
